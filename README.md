# Get rid of Google search result link redirections

This is a GreaseMonkey-compatible userscript that gets rid of the
redirections that Google tends to set up for the first few search results.
Only supports the google.com and google.nl domains so far. Send a pull
request if you want more Google domains.

Chrome supports GreaseMonkey userscripts directly. Drag & drop "Clean
Google search URL.user.js" to Chrome to install it.

Based on [the Clean Google search URL script on sumtips.com](sumtips.com/2011/12/get-clean-unmodified-url.html).
